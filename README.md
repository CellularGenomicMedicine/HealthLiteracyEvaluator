"AI-simplifed information to advance reproductive genetic care and address patient vulnerability" 

Abstract
Background: Reproductive genetic testing reduces the transmission of genetic disorder to offspring; however, its uptake remains limited due to low health literacy and barriers to comprehension of complex information. Large language models (LLMs) provide a novel approach to aid simplifying patient education materials (PEMs), thereby improving accessibility and health equity.

Methods: Here, we conducted a comparative observational study to evaluate the performance of four LLMs—GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Copilot, and Gemini—in simplifying PEMs on reproductive genetics. To this end, we retrieved thirty original texts covering six topics from authoritative websites and simplified them using a consistent prompt. Subsequently, we measured readability improvements using seven standardized metrics and assessed the accuracy of the simplified texts by a panel of experts (n=30) through a blinded evaluation strategy.

Findings: All four LLMs significantly improved the readability of the original texts (p < 0.001, Student’s t test). Among the models, we found that Gemini had the greatest readability improvements, reducing the complexity of texts to a 6th-7th grade reading level. However, GPT-4 demonstrated the highest accuracy and content integrity, ensuring that essential medical information was preserved. This highlights the importance of balancing readability with the retention of critical content to support patient informed decision-making, as excessive simplification may lead to the omission of key information.  

Interpretation: We demonstrated that LLMs are promising in enhancing accessibility to complex reproductive genetic information without compromising accuracy. Their integration into patient education strategies may advance health equity by improving understanding and informed decision-making. However, careful evaluation is required to ensure that simplification does not lead to critical omissions.
