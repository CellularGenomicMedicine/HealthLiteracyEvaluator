## AI Simplify Genetic Text 

This repository contains the implementation for the paper "*AI-powered simplification of reproductive genetic care to enhance accessibility and address patient vulnerability*".

Repository Overview:
1. **src**: scripts and notebook for data analysis, including statistics and plotting.
2. **GUI**: scripts for user interface.
3. **data**: source data for evaluated texts and scores. 

## User interface
We have provided two approaches for the interface.

1. **Local app**: install the packages from `requirements.txt`, run the following command in your terminal. For more instructions, see [doc](https://github.com/CellularGenomicMedicine/LLM_simplifytext/tree/main/GUI).
```
streamlit run app.py
```


2. **Online access**: a demo from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/).
